CV Catalog for [Toploker.com](https://toploker.com)

This is a simple webpage designed to showcase the Toploker.com CV catalog, allowing customers to easily browse through it.

## Project Setup

First of all, copy the *.env.example* file and rename it into *.env* 

Then, edit the credentials into production data.

```bash
VITE_API_URL={YOUR API URL}
VITE_API_BASE_URL={YOUR BASE API URL}
VITE_WHATSAPP_NUMBER={YOUR WHATSAPP NUMBER}
```
>You can build your own API using any API service you prefer. Navigate to the public/assets/static/data.json file to see what the API should look like.

Do *npm install* to install all the required dependecies on the *package.json* file.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server

Well, that's it! Your application is running 😏
